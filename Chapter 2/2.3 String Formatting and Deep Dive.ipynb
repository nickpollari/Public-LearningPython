In most programming situations your strings need to be dynamic and flexible based on what is going on in the code. Additionally, you may need to change the formatting of a given string. We will first begin by going over some of the simple methods that a <font color='lime'>**string**</font> has which will allow you to modify the underlying text in various ways.\n",
