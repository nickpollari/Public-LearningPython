    "# Basic Operators\n",
    "This section will be a quick overview of how to use simple operators such as ```+```, ```-```, ```/```, ```*```, and ```**``` in Python. Python follows the standard and common PEMDAS methodology in terms of the ordering of what mathematical operations happen at each step. What you may not be accustomed to is how basic operators like ```+``` can be used with python objects such as lists. We will explore some of these intricacies as we progress through the content. If you recall previously from Section 2.4 we combined two lists like so;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l1 = ['a', 'b']\n",
    "l2 = ['c', 'd']\n",
    "# l3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "l3 = l1 + l2\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 1. PEMDAS\n",
    "The mathematical operations will happen in the following order;\n",
    "1. **P**arentheses\n",
    "2. **E**xponent\n",
    "3. **M**ultiplication\n",
    "4. **D**ivision\n",
    "5. **A**ddition\n",
    "6. **S**ubtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 2. Adding ( + )\n",
    "The common operator of ```+``` is used to add two numbers together.\n",
    "### 2.1 Float + Float\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 1.5\n",
    "v2 = 2.5\n",
    "# v3 = 4.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2.2 Int + Int\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 1\n",
    "v2 = 4\n",
    "# v3 = 5\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2.3 Float + Int\n",
    "```python \n",
    "v1 = 1\n",
    "v2 = 2.5\n",
    "# v3 = 3.5\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 3. Subtraction ( - )\n",
    "The common operator of ```-``` is used to subtract one number from another. The operations are the same as the addition section and as such we will avoid any duplication by not including additional code in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 4. Divison ( / )\n",
    "The common operator of ```/``` is used to divide one number by another. It is important to understand that in Python whenever you divide any number by another number the result will always be a Float.\n",
    "### 4.1 Float / Float\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 5.0\n",
    "v2 = 2.5\n",
    "# v3 = 2.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.2 Int / Int\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 7\n",
    "v2 = 4\n",
    "# v3 = 1.75\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Even if the numerator can be evenly divided by the divisor the result of the operation is always a Float value.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v3 will be a Float\n",
    "v1 = 8\n",
    "v2 = 4\n",
    "# v3 = 2.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4.3 Float / Int\n",
    "```python \n",
    "v1 = 10.0\n",
    "v2 = 2\n",
    "# v3 = 5.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 5. Floor Division (//)\n",
    "Some times we aren't interested in the numbers to the right of the decimal point when we do division. This is where the Floor Divisor (//) comes into play.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 10.0\n",
    "v2 = 3\n",
    "# v3 = 3\n",
    "v3 = v1 // v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that we didn't return 3.33 which is the correct answer for 10 / 3, we only returned the whole numbers of the operation and dropped everything to the right of the decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 6. Multiplication ( * )\n",
    "The common operator of ```*``` is used to multiply one number to another. The operations are the same as the division section and as such we will avoid any duplication by not including additional code in this section. **There is no Multiplication equivalent of the Floor Divisor.**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 7. Exponent ( ** )\n",
    "The common operator of ```**``` is used to raise a number to the power of another number. This can also be done with the built-in function ```pow()```. We will review both methods below. The resulting object can be a Float or Int depending on whether a Float was used in the calcuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 ** Method\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v3 is an Int\n",
    "v1 = 2\n",
    "v2 = 3\n",
    "# v3 = 8, 2 * 2 * 2\n",
    "v3 = v1 ** v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 7.2 pow Method\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v3 is a float\n",
    "v1 = 2.0\n",
    "v2 = 3\n",
    "# v3 = 8, 2.0 * 2.0 * 2.0\n",
    "v3 = pow(v1, v2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 8. Modulus (%)\n",
    "The Modulus operation is similar to the Floor Division that we covered earlier but instead of returning everything to the left of the decimal like Floor Division this will give us the remainder of the operation.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 10\n",
    "v2 = 3\n",
    "# this will equal 1\n",
    "v3 = 10 % 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## 9. In Place Operations\n",
    "We can also implement our operations in-place without having to redefine variable names. Lets say we had a variable called ```v1``` and we wanted to add ```3``` to its value and then keep the variable name as ```v1```. We could do this in the manner presented below;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 10\n",
    "v1 = v1 + 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "or we could just do this;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 10\n",
    "v1 += 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note the use of the ```+=``` which automatically adds ```3``` to the variable ```v1``` and assigns the new total to the variable ```v1```. All of the following methods work as you would expect;\n",
    "- += (add to the current variable)\n",
    "- -= (subtract from the current variable)\n",
    "- *= (multiply the current variable)\n",
    "- /= (divide the current variable)"
