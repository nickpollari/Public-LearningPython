    "# Basic Operators\n",
    "This section will be a quick overview of how to use simple operators such as ```+```, ```-```, ```/```, ```*```, and ```**``` in Python. Python follows the standard and common PEMDAS methodology in terms of the ordering of what mathematical operations happen at each step. What you may not be accustomed to is how basic operators like ```+``` can be used with python objects such as lists. We will explore some of these intricacies as we progress through the content. If you recall previously from Section 2.4 we combined two lists like so;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "l1 = ['a', 'b']\n",
    "l2 = ['c', 'd']\n",
    "# l3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "l3 = l1 + l2\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## PEMDAS\n",
    "The mathematical operations will happen in the following order;\n",
    "1. **P**arentheses\n",
    "2. **E**xponent\n",
    "3. **M**ultiplication\n",
    "4. **D**ivision\n",
    "5. **A**ddition\n",
    "6. **S**ubtraction\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding ( + )\n",
    "The common operator of ```+``` is used to add two numbers together.\n",
    "### Float + Float\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 1.5\n",
    "v2 = 2.5\n",
    "# v3 = 4.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Int + Int\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 1\n",
    "v2 = 4\n",
    "# v3 = 5\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Float + Int\n",
    "```python \n",
    "v1 = 1\n",
    "v2 = 2.5\n",
    "# v3 = 3.5\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Subtraction ( - )\n",
    "The common operator of ```-``` is used to subtract one number from another. The operations are the same as the addition section and as such we will avoid any duplication by not including additional code in this section.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Divison ( / )\n",
    "The common operator of ```/``` is used to divide one number by another. It is important to understand that in Python whenever you divide any number by another number the result will always be a Float.\n",
    "### Float / Float\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 5.0\n",
    "v2 = 2.5\n",
    "# v3 = 2.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Int / Int\n",
    "```python\n",
    "v1 = 7\n",
    "v2 = 4\n",
    "# v3 = 1.75\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Even if the numerator can be evenly divided by the divisor the result of the operation is always a Float value.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v3 will be a Float\n",
    "v1 = 8\n",
    "v2 = 4\n",
    "# v3 = 2.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Float / Int\n",
    "```python \n",
    "v1 = 10.0\n",
    "v2 = 2\n",
    "# v3 = 5.0\n",
    "v3 = v1 / v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Multiplication ( * )\n",
    "The common operator of ```*``` is used to multiply one number to another. The operations are the same as the division section and as such we will avoid any duplication by not including additional code in this section.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponent ( ** )\n",
    "The common operator of ```**``` is used to raise a number to the power of another number. This can also be done with the built-in function ```pow()```. We will review both methods below. The resulting object can be a Float or Int depending on whether a Float was used in the calcuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ** Method\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v3 is an Int\n",
    "v1 = 2\n",
    "v2 = 3\n",
    "# v3 = 8, 2 * 2 * 2\n",
    "v3 = v1 ** v2\n",
    "```\n",
    "### pow Method\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v3 is a float\n",
    "v1 = 2.0\n",
    "v2 = 3\n",
    "# v3 = 8, 2.0 * 2.0 * 2.0\n",
    "v3 = pow(v1, v2)\n",
    "```"
