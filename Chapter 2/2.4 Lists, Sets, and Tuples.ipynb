    "\n",
    "Let us begin by reviewing the **List** object.\n",
    "## List\n",
    "A list is an object which contains references to other objects, or a list of data, or strings, or... etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Characteristics\n",
    "- A List can have N number of objects in it\n",
    "- A List is Mutable (You can add and remove things from it, change things in it, etc)\n",
    "- A List maintains the order of the items put into it\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_list = [\"a\", \"b\", 1, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example code above we creted a list using the closed brackets **[ ]** which contains two strings and two integers. The **List** can also contain other objects/variables like so;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "some_list = [some_var1, some_var2, \"a\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "A list is not restricted in what type of data it can contain.\n",

    "mikes_name = test_list[0]\n",
    "print(mikes_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "When we provide positive integers to any indexing, we are counting from left to right in the **List**. So if we were to do ```test_list[1]``` we would get **Nick**. We can also go from right to left by providing NEGATIVE integers. If we wanted the LAST item in our test_list we could do any of the following;\n",

    "allie1 = test_list[3]\n",
    "allie2 = test_list[-1]\n",
