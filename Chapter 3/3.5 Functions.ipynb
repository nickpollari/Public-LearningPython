    "## Function General Syntax\n",
    "The first function we write is going to simply add 5 to whatever number is passed into it and return the result. This is written in the following way;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_five_function(a_number):\n",
    "    new_number = a_number + 5\n",
    "    return new_number\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We begin by using <font color='dodgerblue';>**def**</font> to signify that we are <font color='dodgerblue';>**defining**</font> a function. The function is named <font color='goldenrod';>**add_five_function**</font>. Typically in Python we name functions all lower case, excluding numeric values, and using underscores to increase readability. The function takes one argument, called <font color='orangered';>**a_number**</font> which is an alias for any number which we put into it. If you are unsure of what I mean here don't panic, it should become clear momentarily. The argument is wrapped in paranthesis and the first line of a function is ended with a **:** to signify that this is the function end. Finally the argument uses the built-in command <font color='blueviolet';>**return**</font> to bring the results out of the function. It is **not** required to have a <font color='blueviolet';>**return**</font> in a function and in this case once the logic is done executing the function simple exits and doesn't return any results. \n",

This is how name space works in Python. Any variable names which you use outside of functions retain their names and values outisde of those functions (this also goes for a **Class** but we won't get into that right now) while any variable names used inside of a function retain their names and values inside of the function.\n",

    "We briefly reviewed the concept of an argument for a function when we discussed the <font color='orangered';>**a_number**</font> argument for our function <font color='goldenrod';>**add_five_function**</font>. Python has **TWO** kinds of arguments; <font color='hotpink';>**positional argument**</font> and <font color='crimson';>**keyword argument**</font>. In both of the example functions we used <font color='hotpink';>**positional argument**</font>s which use an alias to refer to a particular object and are passed to the function in a particular order (hence, positional). The other kind of argument is a <font color='crimson';>**keyword argument**</font> and these are placed **after** the <font color='hotpink';>**positional argument**</font>s. You can think of <font color='crimson';>**keyword argument**</font>s as **optional** arguments. The function may or may not use them or they might denote the default value of an argument for a particular function. Below is an example a function with both a <font color='hotpink';>**positional argument**</font> and a <font color='crimson';>**keyword argument**</font>.\n",
    "```python\n",

For readability purposes it isn't recommended to put too many arguments into a function, as this usually means its possible to break that function up into smaller pieces. In some cases, including if you look at production code or answers on popular coding websites like stackoverflow, you will come across something like ```**args``` and ```**kwargs```. These can be used to condense a large number of <font color='hotpink';>**positional argument**</font>s into a single tuple (```**args```) or a large number of <font color='crimson';>**keyword argument**</font>s into a single dictionary (```**kwargs```).

You will have to write these yourself and we will use the multi-line string you learned about earlier. The **Doc String** basically has 3 general parts to it; Summary, Args, Return. The format of the **Doc String** is flexible and you don't have to do yours like mine, or like the way Numpy does theirs, as long as it contains similar information. Below is an example of a **Doc String** I wrote for a function which computes a moving average.
