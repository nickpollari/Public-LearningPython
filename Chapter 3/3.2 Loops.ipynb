    "# Loops\n",
    "In many situations you may find that you need to perform some operation for each element in an **interable**. An **interable** is any Python Object which contains multiple other objects and can be **looped** through. This includes Python Objects like; **List**, **Tuple**, **Set**, **Dictionary**, and many others. \n",

    "## For You\n",
    "The basic way to **Loop** through an object is using the <font color='indianred';>**for**</font> clause.\n",

    "some_list = [5, 10, 20]\n",
    "for i in some_list:\n",
    "    print(pow(i, 2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The structure of the <font color='indianred';>**for**</font> loop is that we create an alias for each element in the **iterable**,  in this case we used ```i```, to represent each element that is **in** some object. The code above will print out the squared value of the elements in ```some_list```. On each loop the variable ```i``` is equal to the corresponding value in ```some_list``` so the first time around ```i=5``` and the second time ```i=10```, etc. You should also note that the end of the line of the <font color='indianred';>**for**</font> loop contains a ```:``` and that the code of the actual logic is indented underneath the <font color='indianred';>**for**</font> clause.\n",

As you can see in the code below we have a **List** where each element in the **List** is actually a **Tuple**. Notice that this time, instead of iterating through the list and using the alias ```i``` as we did previously that we now are using a **Tuple** of ```(key, val)```. The alias we are using now allows us to iterate through each tuple by each element of the tuple. If we just used ```i``` as before than each ```i``` in the loop would be a **Tuple** itself. \n",

    "## List Comprehension\n",

    "Python also supports the ability to embed a <font color='indianred';>**for**</font> loop inside of a **Dictionary**.

The <font color='indianred';>**for**</font> loop is similar to the one we previously covered which allowed for you to iterate through a list where each element is actually made up of multiple objects. We also had to use the <font color='hotpink';>**items**</font> method of the dictionary to convert it to a list of tuples. Just as before we can also build an if statement into this as well;\n",
