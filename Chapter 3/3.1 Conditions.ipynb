    "# Conditions\n",
    "Frequently you will find yourself in a situation where you need to make a decision about what to do with a Python object <font color='gold';>**depending**</font> on criteria(s) being met (or not met). This concept of **Conditioning** is extremely common in code and if you look at code in the wild you will also find a significant use of the <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## If what?\n",
    "The <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> statement has the following structure;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if SOME_CRITERIA:\n",
    "    # if SOME_CRITERIA\n",
    "    # evaluates to True then\n",
    "    # execute the code in here\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # if SOME_CRITERIA\n",
    "    # evaluates to False then\n",
    "    # execute the code in here\n",
    "    a = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "The end of the <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> criteria is always followed by a ```:``` to denote to Python that this is the end of the criteria that needs to be evaluated. The <font color='dodgerblue';>**else**</font> statement also requires the ```:``` to let Python know this is the end of our <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## Else who?\n",
    "The <font color='dodgerblue';>**else**</font> statement is **completely optional**. The following is also a valid <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> statement;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = None\n",
    "variable = 5\n",
    "SOME_CRITERIA = variable > 0\n",
    "if SOME_CRITERIA:\n",
    "    a = \"variable must be > 0\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is not necessary to define your criteria and assign it to an object ahead of the <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> statement;\n",

    "variable = 5\n",
    "if variable > 0:\n",
    "    a = \"variable must be > 0\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Excluding of the <font color='dodgerblue';>**else**</font> statement is essentially the same as doing the following;\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = None\n",
    "variable = 5\n",
    "if variable > 0:\n",
    "    a = \"variable must be > 0\"\n",

    "## Conditioning Operators\n",
    "Python allows you to use the following operators to signify their commonly understood meanings.\n",
    "- ```>``` : greater-than\n",
    "- ```<``` : less-than\n",
    "- ```>=``` : greater-than-or-equal-to\n",

    "## Spacing and Indentation\n",
    "Once you have ended the <font color='blueviolet';>**if**</font> or <font color='dodgerblue';>**else**</font> statement it is common practice to move to the next line and then **INDENT** your code.\n",
