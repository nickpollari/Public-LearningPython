    "# Numpy\n",
    "Numpy is the core library for most scientific computing in Python and allows users to perform matrix and vector operations in Python. It is the back-end for many of the popular packages used in Python including Pandas, Scipy, Sci-kit Learn, etc. A thorough Numpy tutorial is beyond the scope of the this work so please refer to the official Numpy website in the link below. In this work we will cover some of the basic operations in Numpy and basic structures along with one of the most important Numpy modules. Execute the code in the cell below to import the package. The standard convention in Python is to import the Numpy package with the alias ```np```. \n",
