    "The first intermediate functionality from Pandas that we are going to explore is ```.apply()``` which will allow us to apply a function across each column of a DataFrame or across each row of a DataFrame. To begin we are going to pull down all of the prices for the DOW 30 stocks. The 30 stocks are provided below along with the standard imports we will need for this section. Execute the code in the cell below. Using ```.apply()``` is often a way to speed up the calculations of Pandas."
