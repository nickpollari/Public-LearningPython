    "# Concat and Join\n",
    "Sometimes we have data which might belong together but somehow ended up in two different DataFrames, or scattered across a DataFrame and a Series. Pandas has excellent documentation on how to leverage ```merge```, ```join```, and ```concat```. I find myself using ```join``` and ```concat``` the most so I will review both of these pandas methods. Execute the code below to generate some data for us to play with. The link below contains an excellent review of this content;\n",
